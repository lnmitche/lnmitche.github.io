        <h2>German Chocolate Cake</h2>
        <p>German chocolate cake is the superior dessert and here is why:
            Firstly, it's chocolate! Plenty of people love chocolate. The eggs and buttermilk in the cake make it the right texture (if you know how to bake), and the frosting has pecans and coconut mixed into it. Coffee could actually be added to it if desired (caffeine lovers, beware! there's a LOT of caffeine in the coffee made for this cake). It has been a family favorite for decades.
